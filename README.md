üìò Overview

This project applies machine-learning algorithms‚ÄîNa√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Clustering‚Äîto analyze and predict financial market behavior.
Using data from 26,000+ companies (2000 ‚Äì 2024), the goal is to classify firms by industry group and predict Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios based on key financial indicators such as EPS, Working Capital, Book Value, Debt, and Capital Expenditure

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

Dataset reduced to fiscal years 2000‚Äì2024 (235 996 records √ó 301 features).

Removed columns with > 50 % missing values.

Median imputation for numerical NAs; irrelevant categorical fields dropped.

Outliers handled via winsorization (1st‚Äì99th percentiles); all numeric fields log-transformed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Analytics

Correlation Matrix: EPS and Net Income strongly positive (~0.9).

EPS by Year: Post-2010 stability and growth; dips in 2008 & 2020 reflect crisis periods.

Boxplots & Scatterplots: EPS vs NI show positive correlation and high dispersion

3Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Models
Model	Accuracy	Key Findings
Na√Øve Bayes	17.6 %	Poor performance; feature independence assumption invalid

LAB 5 NA√èVE BAYES

.
Decision Tree	39.8 %	Better results; max_depth = 5 balances fit and generalization

LAB 5 DECISION TREE

.
SVM (Linear)	85 %	Best accuracy & F1 ‚âà 0.84; handles high-dimensional data effectively

4Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Analysis

K-Means (k = 8) identified distinct industry segments with P/E ratio and EPS patterns.

Hierarchical Clustering: Silhouette score 0.46 with 4 clusters revealing financial strength tiers

üìä Key Insights
Insight	Interpretation
SVM dominates	Linear kernel (C = 10) yielded 85 % accuracy and balanced precision/recall

LAB 5 SVM

.
Decision Tree bias	Overfits to dominant classes with weak recall for minor industries

LAB 5 DECISION TREE

.
Na√Øve Bayes fails	Independence assumption breaks for correlated financial metrics

LAB 5 NA√èVE BAYES

.
K-Means segmentation	Revealed growth vs risk clusters useful for investment screening

üí° Business Application

Investor Targeting: Identify undervalued or high-growth firms by cluster profile.

Risk Assessment: Distinguish financially weak vs strong companies for credit or M&A.

Benchmarking: SVM industry classification enables peer comparison and sector forecasting.

üöÄ Future Work

Introduce financial ratios (e.g., ROA, Debt/Equity) to improve class separation.

Explore ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning architectures.

Integrate textual sentiment data from filings or news for multi-modal prediction
